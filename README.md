# UVM-ME003
A first overview of computational engineering, data science and robotics for mechanical engineering students at the University of Vermont


## Welcome

This course is intended for first year students in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Vermont. The Department of Mechanical Engineering recognizes that computational engineering is as necessary to our graduates as solid or fluid mechanics. ME003's main goals are to give students a solid foundation in the number one language in engineering (python), and introduce students to the art and logic of algorithm design, verification and validation. Our world is automated, and numerical. Nowadays most engineering systems incorporate sensors that report to computing untis for health monitoring, control or optimization. So let's embrace together computational engineering

## Pedagogical approach

ME003 is an online course, using python notebooks in lieu of textbook. Python notebook are dynamic documents that include text, images, and codes. Codes can be edited, executed and their output printed in the notebook. Python notebook is , in the opinion of the designers of this course, one of the best teaching tools currently available for its interactivity with the user. It comes with caveats. For instance deleting a variable does not mean the variable is removed from memory.

As much as possible, the notebooks will be supplemented by videos available on BlackBoard for UVM students. We are still building these videos, so please be patient and understanding.

Coding inherently requires a lot of your own search. It is impossible to cover all functions of python in lectures and even more impossible to cover error messages. You will find yourself on google a lot and your browser will probably have multiple tabs open on python documentation, stackoverflow, google and various python tutorials. This is what engineers do. One key skill is knowing how to search for the information relevant to your problem.

Imagine that you are completing an assignment. You wrote a code you thought is flawless, but when executed a red cell appears in your python notebook with many lines of warnings and errors. What should you do?
<ol>
<li> Email the instructor right away with the message "my code does not work"</li>
<li> Email the instructor right away with the message "my code does not work" and attached your code and the error message</li>
<li> Read the last line of the error message and try to make sense of it. Search the whole error message for the line that crashes your code</li>
<li> If the error message does not make sense to you, copy and paste the last line of the error message into google</li>
<li> Ask for help on stackoverflow</li>
</ol>

For your very first action, the wrong answers are 1, 2, and 5. If the engine you designed as an engineer does not work, you don't walk away and request somebody else to fix it. You are EXPECTED to fix it or at least give your very best shot at finding the problem (it might not be your design, it might be a third-party component). Debugging a code is like debugging an engine. It is an exercise of logic, or problem reduction. 

There is one key difference though: python has very few bugs, unlike engine components. If it crashes, especially in ME003 there is a one in a million chance you found a python bug. In other words, if the code does not work, it is 100% your fault.

You will learn coding faster by debugging by yourself. If you find yourself stuck in options 3  and 4, then use option 2

## Assignments

There will be one assignment a week, posted on blackboard and github, due on Thursday. See syllabus on BB for more details.

## Python and jupyter-lab

<ul>
<li> Download and install python 3 from  <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">anaconda</a> (make sure that you choose the appropriate OS</li>
<li> In your favorite workspace (Desktop, Documents, ...), create a folder ME003</li>
<li> Download the first tutorial and move the downloaded .zip or folder to the folder ME003</li>
<li> Open Anaconda navigator and open juypter-notebook or jupyter-lab</li>
<li> This app opens in your browser, navigate to the folder ME003 and eventually into the folder of your assignment</li>
<li> Open the document finishing with ".ipynb"</li>
<li> There is a play button on top of the window. Read each cell, once you are done, press play.</li>
</ul>
