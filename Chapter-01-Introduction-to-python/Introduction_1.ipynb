    "### How to use this notebook:\n",
    "This document is called a Jupyter Notebook. It is the platform used for this course as it enables us to run code and read text all in one interactive document. Its developers describe The Jupyter Notebook as \"... an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\" Jupyter Lab/Notebook is an application that has capability to run 40 different types of code. As you know this class is on Python. The code is stored and compiled on your computer but displayed in your browser. You do not need an internet connection to develop, compile or save code in Jupyter. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "How to use: <br>\n",
    "For you as the student when you open the Jupyter notebook, all of the code will already have run but you will need to run and re-run cells when you enter code.<br>\n",
    "**run an individual cell:** click on the cell and hold **shift** + press **enter**<br>\n",
    "*The following commands are good to know but you likely won't have to use them unless you make a mistake or want to add a note or additional cell.* <br>\n",
    "**add cell above:** **a**<br>\n",
    "**add cell below:** **b**<br>\n",

    "**cut cell:** click on left hand margin and type **x**<br>\n",
    "**delete cell:** click on left hand margin and type **dd** (d twice)<br>\n",

    "https://stackoverflow.com Invaluable forum website for nearly any coding language. User posts question, another user (shows experience level) posts solution which gets voted up or down by other users based on accuracy.
